# Multi-Node Ray Train on EKS

Run a distributed PyTorch FSDP training job with Ray Train across **two GPU
nodes** on Amazon EKS, using the Ray Train DLC. This is the training
counterpart to
[`inference/ray-serve/ray-serve-multi-node`](../../inference/ray-serve/ray-serve-multi-node):
same KubeRay-on-EKS foundation, but a `RayCluster` running a job to completion
instead of a `RayService` serving traffic.

The [Ray Train DLC](https://aws.github.io/deep-learning-containers/ray-train/)
ships Ray Train, PyTorch, and the EFA stack (libfabric and aws-ofi-nccl)
already built and version-matched, so the worker image needs no build step --
it is a public, pre-built image. That is the thing this sample demonstrates:
getting a correctly-configured multi-node, EFA-backed training job running on
EKS without hand-building any of that stack yourself.

## Success criteria

This sample's bar is infrastructure-level, not training quality -- the
training job itself (loss, convergence, dataset) is out of scope. What
`deploy_ray_train_job.sh` checks and gates on:

| # | Criterion | How it's checked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Both GPU nodes advertise their GPUs | `nvidia.com/gpu` allocatable on both nodes |
| 2 | Both GPU nodes advertise EFA | `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa` allocatable on both nodes |
| 3 | The job schedules and runs | head pod Ready, both worker pods Running |
| 4 | NCCL selected the EFA fabric, not sockets | worker logs show `NET/OFI Selected provider is efa`, and *not* `Using network Socket` |
| 5 | EFA's RDMA capability is present | `fi_info -p efa` inside a worker pod reports `FI_RMA`/`FI_EP_RDM` |
| 6 | The job starts and completes | `ray job submit` exits 0; `train.py` prints a `[train] SUCCESS` line per rank |

**On RDMA, precisely:** `g6.12xlarge` is EFA-capable with real, network-level
RDMA (libfabric read/write between hosts), but it does **not** have
GPUDirect RDMA (the NIC DMA'ing straight into GPU memory) -- that requires
`p4d`/`p4de`/`p5`/`p5e`/`p5en`/`p6`/`trn1`. Criterion 5 above confirms the
former; it is not evidence of the latter, and this README does not claim it.

## What this sample builds

Two `g6.12xlarge` GPU worker nodes (4x NVIDIA L4, 48 vCPU, 192 GiB, 1 EFA
interface each), each running 4 Ray Train workers -- `WORLD_SIZE=8` total.
Ray Train's `TorchTrainer` full-parameter fine-tunes
[`Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B) (ungated) with
PyTorch **FSDP**, which shards the model's parameters, gradients, and AdamW
optimizer state across every GPU in the job. Any FSDP all-gather/
reduce-scatter between a rank on one node and a rank on the other crosses the
node boundary over **[EFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html)**.
`code/train.py` trains on synthetic token ids for a handful of steps -- the
point is exercising the real multi-node NCCL/EFA collective path, not
achieving a training result, so there is no dataset to stage.

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools before running any scripts:

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) with credentials configured
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/installation/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install the KubeRay operator and GPU device plugins (auto-installed via `brew` or the official script if missing)
- [envsubst](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) is used to render the manifest

Verify that your AWS credentials are active, and check `g6.12xlarge` capacity
and G-family vCPU quota (2 x g6.12xlarge = 96 vCPU) in your target region
before picking one:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## Directory Structure

      manifest/     # KubeRay RayCluster manifest
      code/         # The Ray Train training script (train.py)
```

## Configuration

All scripts share a single configuration file: `scripts/env.sh`. Override any
variable by exporting it before running a script. `env.sh` also loads
`scripts/.placement.env` if it exists -- the `REGION`/`GPU_AZ` that
`deploy_all.sh` last chose -- so its values replace the `REGION` default
below; anything you export still wins. Delete that file to go back to the
defaults. Set the Region with `REGION`, not `AWS_REGION`: `env.sh` sets
`AWS_REGION`/`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` from `REGION`, overriding whatever your
shell or AWS CLI profile has.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLUSTER_NAME | eks-cluster | EKS cluster name |
| REGION | us-east-2 | AWS region |
| K8S_VERSION | 1.36 | Kubernetes version |
| NODE_AMI_FAMILY | AmazonLinux2023 | Node AMI family, set explicitly rather than left to eksctl's default |
| SYSTEM_NODE_TYPE | m7i.xlarge | Instance type for system/head nodes |
| SYSTEM_NODE_COUNT | 1 | Number of system nodes |
| GPU_NODE_TYPE | g6.12xlarge | GPU worker instance type |
| GPU_NODE_COUNT | 2 | Number of GPU worker nodes |
| GPUS_PER_NODE | 4 | GPUs per `GPU_NODE_TYPE` -- must match the instance type if you change it |
| GPU_NODEGROUP_NAME | gpu-workers | Name of the GPU node group |
| CAPACITY_RESERVATION_ID | _(empty)_ | An existing On-Demand Capacity Reservation to launch the GPU nodes into, e.g. `cr-0123456789abcdef0`. The node group targets it, its AZ is used, and the capacity search is skipped. Validated for state, instance type and available count; `REGION` must be the reservation's Region |
| GPU_AZ | _(auto)_ | AZ for the GPU node group. Auto-picked from AZs that both offer `GPU_NODE_TYPE` *and* already have a cluster private subnet; if set explicitly, validated against that same intersection and rejected with a reason otherwise |
| ASSUME_YES | _(empty)_ | Set to `1` to skip the "Proceed? (y/N)" prompt in `deploy_cluster.sh`/`deploy_node_group.sh`. Set by `deploy_all.sh` (and by `find_gpu_capacity.sh` when you accept its deploy offer) after their own single prompt -- not something you normally set by hand |
| DLC_IMAGE | public.ecr.aws/deep-learning-containers/ray:train-ml-cuda-v1.1 | Ray Train DLC image |
| KUBERAY_VERSION | 1.4.0 | KubeRay operator version |
| RAY_VERSION | 2.58.0 | Ray version (must match the image) |
| NVIDIA_DEVICE_PLUGIN_VERSION | 0.20.0 | NVIDIA device plugin Helm chart version |
| EFA_DEVICE_PLUGIN_VERSION | v0.5.32 | AWS EFA device plugin Helm chart version -- confirmed to allowlist `g6.12xlarge` |
| NAMESPACE | ray-train | Kubernetes namespace |
| RAY_CLUSTER_NAME | ray-train-cluster | Name of the RayCluster |
| MODEL_ID | Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B | Model fine-tuned by `code/train.py` |

| SEQ_LEN | 128 | Synthetic sequence length |
| BATCH_SIZE | 1 | Per-worker batch size |
| LEARNING_RATE | 0.00002 | Optimizer learning rate |
| NUM_WORKERS | 0 | Ray Train workers; 0 = auto-size to the cluster's GPU count (8) |
| BENCH_STEPS | 20 | Steps per run for `benchmark_efa_vs_tcp.sh` (larger than STEPS for a stable steps/sec) |
| BENCH_WARMUP_STEPS | 3 | Leading steps timed but excluded from the benchmark's steps/sec (warm-up costs) |

## Quickstart: build the infrastructure, then run the job

Building the infrastructure and running the training job are separate steps.
Infrastructure is slow, billed, and built once; the job is quick and you
re-run it as often as you like, so a training failure never sends you back
through cluster setup.

**1. Build the infrastructure** (cluster, GPU node group, device plugins,
KubeRay) with one command:

```bash
cd scripts
./deploy_all.sh                                  # search REGION from env.sh
./deploy_all.sh -r "us-east-2 us-east-1 us-west-2"
./deploy_all.sh --plan                           # show what it would do; creates nothing
```

`g6.12xlarge` capacity shifts between Regions/AZs day to day, so
`deploy_all.sh` first runs `find_gpu_capacity.sh --probe` to find where the
two nodes can actually launch (see Step 2 below), then runs
`deploy_cluster.sh`, `deploy_node_group.sh`, `install_gpu_plugins.sh`, and
`install_kuberay.sh` in that Region. If the node group can't launch in the
best AZ, it removes it and tries the next candidate AZ. It asks once
(`Proceed with the whole chain without further prompts? (y/N)`; `-y` skips
even that) and stops after KubeRay. The chosen Region/AZ is saved to
`scripts/.placement.env`, which every other script reads, so later commands
target the same place without re-exporting anything. Every step is
idempotent: re-running after a failure picks up where it stopped, and an
already-`ACTIVE` GPU node group is reused rather than searched for again.

**2. Run the training job** (Step 5 below), as many times as you like:

```bash
./deploy_ray_train_job.sh
./benchmark_efa_vs_tcp.sh                        # optional: EFA vs TCP throughput
```

To do both in one go, pass `--train` (the job too) or `--benchmark` (the job
and the benchmark) to `deploy_all.sh`.

Run each step by hand instead with the step-by-step section below.

## Step-by-step deployment

```bash
cd scripts
```

### Step 1: Create the EKS cluster

```bash
./deploy_cluster.sh
```

Provisions the EKS cluster (VPC, OIDC, core add-ons) and a CPU **system** node
group (`m7i.xlarge`, `AmazonLinux2023` AMI) that runs system workloads, the
KubeRay operator, and the Ray head. Nodes run in private subnets with
outbound access through a NAT Gateway. Cluster subnets are placed in the
Availability Zones that actually offer `$GPU_NODE_TYPE`, so the GPU node
group always has a usable subnet. Idempotent: safe to re-run if interrupted.
15-20 minutes on a fresh run.

### Step 2: Add GPU worker nodes

First, find an AZ where the two nodes can actually launch:

```bash
./find_gpu_capacity.sh                         # REGION from env.sh
./find_gpu_capacity.sh -r "us-east-2 us-east-1 us-west-2"
./find_gpu_capacity.sh -r us-east-2 --probe    # confirm capacity (see below)
```

An instance type being *offered* in an AZ doesn't mean you can launch it
there. This script checks the three things that each fail independently:
the type is offered in the AZ, your On-Demand vCPU quota for the family has
room for `GPU_NODE_COUNT` nodes (2 x g6.12xlarge = 96 G/VT vCPUs), and the
cluster has a private subnet in that AZ. No read-only API reports
On-Demand capacity, so the table also shows the Spot placement score as a
rough signal. `--probe` gives the definitive answer by creating an
On-Demand Capacity Reservation for the nodes in each candidate AZ and
cancelling it immediately (billed at the On-Demand rate for the seconds it
exists). It prints the `export REGION=... GPU_AZ=...` to use and, for any
Region marked `SHORT`, the `service-quotas` command to request more.

When run on its own, it then offers once to build the infrastructure in the
recommended Region/AZ (`deploy_cluster.sh` through `install_kuberay.sh`, the
same chain as `deploy_all.sh` but without its AZ fallback or saved
placement). Like `deploy_all.sh`, it stops after KubeRay. It skips the offer,
and tells you why, if the cluster already exists without a subnet in that AZ;
see **AZ/subnet resolution** below.

Then create the node group:

```bash
./deploy_node_group.sh                         # GPU_AZ auto-picked and cluster-checked
GPU_AZ=us-east-2b ./deploy_node_group.sh       # or pin one explicitly
```

Creates the GPU node group: 2x `g6.12xlarge` with EFA enabled, pinned to a
single AZ (EFA cannot cross AZs), labeled `role=gpu-worker` so the Ray workers
target them via a `nodeSelector`, and labeled `nvidia.com/gpu.present=true` so
the NVIDIA device plugin's default affinity matches without needing Node
Feature Discovery. Runs in private subnets with no public IPs. `AmiType` is
resolved automatically to the accelerated, GPU-capable variant of
`NODE_AMI_FAMILY` -- the driver ships with that AMI, but is not yet advertised
to kubelet (that's the device plugin's job, next step). 3-5 minutes.

**AZ/subnet resolution is cluster-aware, not just capacity-aware.**
`GPU_NODE_TYPE` being *offered* in an AZ doesn't mean the cluster has a
subnet there -- capacity can shift to an AZ the cluster's VPC was never given
a subnet in (e.g. the cluster predates that AZ having capacity, or was
created with a different AZ set). `resolve_gpu_az` in `scripts/_lib.sh`
intersects "AZs offering `GPU_NODE_TYPE`" with "AZs the cluster actually has
a private subnet in" and picks (or validates `GPU_AZ` against) that
intersection only; `deploy_node_group.sh` then resolves the AZ to the
cluster's exact subnet id and passes that to eksctl directly (`subnets:`, not
`availabilityZones:`), so the node group cannot land in a subnet other than
the cluster's own. If the intersection is empty, the script fails immediately
with the mismatched AZ lists and the fix, instead of letting eksctl discover
it the slow way as a stuck CloudFormation stack.

### Step 3: Install the GPU device plugins

```bash
./install_gpu_plugins.sh
```

The accelerated AMI provides the NVIDIA driver and the EFA kernel module, but
neither is advertised to kubelet as an allocatable resource without a device
plugin DaemonSet -- a fresh cluster has neither installed. This installs both
at pinned versions and waits for both DaemonSets to be Ready on every GPU
node before printing `nvidia.com/gpu`/`vpc.amazonaws.com/efa` allocatable
counts. **A healthy Helm release is not evidence the DaemonSet is running** --
both plugins have their own node-affinity requirements (an instance-type
allowlist for EFA, the `nvidia.com/gpu.present` label for NVIDIA), so this
step verifies the actual DaemonSet status, not just `helm list`. 1-2 minutes.

### Step 4: Install the KubeRay operator

```bash
./install_kuberay.sh
```

Installs the KubeRay operator via Helm, pinned to the system node group.
KubeRay watches the `RayCluster` you apply next and wires the head-to-worker
join automatically. Idempotent. 1-2 minutes.

### Step 5: Deploy the RayCluster and run the training job

```bash
./deploy_ray_train_job.sh
```

This is the sample's test script, and it gates on the success criteria above.
It renders `manifest/raycluster.yaml` and applies it, **re-checks**
`nvidia.com/gpu`/`vpc.amazonaws.com/efa` are allocatable (fails fast here
rather than as an opaque `Pending` timeout if a device plugin didn't
schedule), waits for the head pod to be Ready and both worker pods to be
Running, copies `code/` onto the head pod, then runs:

```bash
kubectl exec <head-pod> -n ray-train -c ray-head -- \
    ray job submit --address http://localhost:8265 --working-dir /tmp/ray-train-code -- \
    python3 train.py --model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B --steps 5 --seq_len 128 \
        --batch_size 1 --learning_rate 0.00002 --num_workers 0
```

The job is submitted from inside the head pod (port 8265 is never exposed
outside the cluster). Each Ray Train worker downloads the model weights from
Hugging Face itself on first load, out through the NAT Gateway; there is no
S3 staging step, and the 4 workers in a pod share one download cache, which
is lost when the pod is replaced.

`ray job submit` blocks and streams the job's logs; the script exits non-zero
if the job fails. After the job completes it checks the worker logs for the
EFA confirmation line (and, separately, for the sockets-fallback line -- a
job over TCP looks identical to a healthy one in `kubectl get pods`), then
runs `fi_info -p efa` inside a worker pod to confirm RDMA capability. It exits
non-zero if either check fails, so the whole script works as a CI gate on all
six criteria, not just "the job exited 0."

### Check status

```bash
./deploy_ray_train_job.sh status
```

Shows the RayCluster state, the head + worker pods (with the node each landed
on), and GPU capacity.

## Confirming EFA and RDMA yourself

A healthy deployment: the head and KubeRay operator on the CPU system node, one
worker per GPU node, each advertising 4 GPUs and 1 EFA interface.

```
$ kubectl get nodes -L role,node.kubernetes.io/instance-type,topology.kubernetes.io/zone
NAME                 ROLE         INSTANCE-TYPE   ZONE
ip-192-168-126-175   system       m7i.xlarge      sa-east-1b
ip-192-168-70-51     gpu-worker   g6.12xlarge     sa-east-1a
ip-192-168-92-26     gpu-worker   g6.12xlarge     sa-east-1a

$ kubectl get nodes -l role=gpu-worker \
    -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,GPU:.status.allocatable.nvidia\.com/gpu,EFA:.status.allocatable.vpc\.amazonaws\.com/efa'
NAME               GPU   EFA
ip-192-168-70-51   4     1
ip-192-168-92-26   4     1
```

NCCL runs inside the Ray Train worker actors, which log to Ray's per-worker
session logs (`/tmp/ray/session_*/logs/`) inside the pod, not the container
stdout -- so `kubectl logs` won't show these lines; grep the session logs:

```bash
# NCCL's transport choice
WPOD=$(kubectl get pod -n ray-train -l ray.io/node-type=worker -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec "$WPOD" -n ray-train -c ray-worker -- \
  bash -c 'grep -rhiE "NET/OFI Selected provider|Libfabric|Using network Socket" /tmp/ray/session_*/logs/'
```

Captured output:

```
NCCL INFO NET/OFI Initializing aws-ofi-nccl 1.20.0
NCCL INFO NET/OFI Selected provider is efa, fabric is efa (found 1 nics)
NCCL INFO Channel 00/0 : 7[3] -> 0[0] [receive] via NET/Libfabric/0
```

`7[3] -> 0[0]` is a collective between a rank on one node and a rank on the
other, riding `NET/Libfabric` over EFA. `Using network Socket` or `Selected
provider is sockets` would mean it is not -- check that the pod requested
`vpc.amazonaws.com/efa`, that the EFA device plugin is Ready on that node, and
that `FI_PROVIDER=efa` reached the container.

```bash
# EFA's RDMA capability (network-level; not GPUDirect)
WPOD=$(kubectl get pod -n ray-train -l ray.io/node-type=worker -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec "$WPOD" -n ray-train -c ray-worker -- fi_info -p efa
```

Captured output -- look for `FI_EP_RDM` (network-level RDMA):

```
provider: efa
    fabric: efa-direct
    type: FI_EP_RDM
provider: efa
    fabric: efa
    type: FI_EP_RDM
```

## Benchmark: EFA/RDMA vs TCP

The checks above confirm EFA *carries* the job; this measures how much faster
that makes it. Once the RayCluster is running (after `deploy_ray_train_job.sh`
has run at least once), from `scripts/`:

```bash
./benchmark_efa_vs_tcp.sh
```

It runs the same FSDP job twice on the same cluster, changing only the NCCL
transport for the cross-node collectives:

| Run | Transport env | Collectives ride |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EFA | `FI_PROVIDER=efa`, `NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=ofi` | EFA / RDMA |
| TCP | `NCCL_NET=Socket`, `FI_PROVIDER=tcp` | TCP over `eth0` |

Same nodes, same model, same steps, so the steps/sec difference is the
transport. FSDP's cross-node all-gather/reduce-scatter is exactly the traffic
EFA accelerates, so the gap shows even on a short run (`BENCH_STEPS` steps, the
first `BENCH_WARMUP_STEPS` discarded). The script verifies from each run's
worker logs that the intended transport actually engaged before comparing --
otherwise a silent socket fallback would look like a valid run -- then averages
the per-rank `steps_per_sec` and prints the speedup.

Example result (2x `g6.12xlarge`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B`, `WORLD_SIZE=8`, 20 steps):

```
=== Results: EFA/RDMA vs TCP ===
  TCP (sockets, baseline)    0.2513 steps/sec
  EFA / RDMA                 0.5173 steps/sec

  EFA/RDMA speedup vs TCP: 2.06x
```

EFA/RDMA roughly doubled throughput here. The multiple grows with model size,
batch size, and sequence length -- anything that puts more bytes on the
cross-node collectives -- and on GPUDirect-capable instances (`p4d`/`p5`).

Raw per-rank throughput is in the Ray session logs inside a worker pod:

```bash
WPOD=$(kubectl get pod -n ray-train -l ray.io/node-type=worker -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec "$WPOD" -n ray-train -c ray-worker -- \
  bash -c 'grep -rh "\[train\] THROUGHPUT" /tmp/ray/session_*/logs/'
```

## Beyond this sample

- **True GPUDirect RDMA.** Swap `GPU_NODE_TYPE`/`GPUS_PER_NODE` for a
  `p4d`/`p4de`/`p5`/`p5e`/`p5en`/`p6`/`trn1` instance to exercise transfers
  straight into GPU memory. Everything else in this sample is unchanged;
  only the EFA-vs-TCP bandwidth gap becomes far larger than on `g6`.
- **Placement group.** This sample pins the GPU node group to a single,
  explicitly-resolved AZ, which is EFA's real requirement. A cluster
  placement group additionally tightens physical proximity within that AZ
  for lower, more consistent latency -- worth adding if you're chasing
  bandwidth, not required for the correctness criteria above.
- **Shared storage for real training.** `code/train.py` has no dataset or
  checkpoint to persist, and pulls the model straight from Hugging Face, so
  there's no FSx/S3 dependency here. A real
  training job that stages a dataset/model or checkpoints across worker
  restarts needs shared storage such as FSx for Lustre or an `s3://` URI --
  see the [Ray Train DLC EKS guide](https://aws.github.io/deep-learning-containers/ray-train/deployment/eks/)
  for the FSx-backed manifest shape.

## Teardown (reverse order)

```bash
cd scripts
```

```bash
./delete_ray_train_job.sh        # Delete the RayCluster
./install_kuberay.sh cleanup     # Uninstall the KubeRay operator
./install_gpu_plugins.sh cleanup # Uninstall the GPU device plugins
./delete_node_group.sh           # Delete the GPU node group
./delete_cluster.sh              # Delete the EKS cluster
```

These target the Region saved in `scripts/.placement.env` (if `deploy_all.sh`
created one). Delete that file afterwards if your next deployment should
start from the `env.sh` defaults.

## Cost

Running cost is roughly **$9.50/hr** while the GPU node group is up: 2x
`g6.12xlarge`, the EKS control plane, and a NAT Gateway (no FSx in this
sample). Tear down when not actively working with it.
